# Live2dMetalMacOSDemo
Live2d Metal Demo for macOS, modified from the iOS demo, basically nothing changed, don't understand why live2d didn't add macOS content.

Download sdk from https://www.live2d.com/en/sdk/about/

clone this repo to Samples/Metal/Demo/proj.ios.cmake/build and name it proj_xcode_macOS
